# WIRELESS-PULSE-MONITORING-SYSTEM
Develop a wireless pulse monitoring system 
using two Raspberry Pi units. 
This system will capture pulse signals through a sensor, 
transmit the data over Bluetooth, and display the pulse 
data along with other relevant health metrics on a GUI at the 
receiving end.
